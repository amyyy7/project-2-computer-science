<h2>The United States has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the world. 3 in 10 teen girls will get pregnant at least once before age the 20. That is nearly 750,000 teen pregnancies every year.
Parenthood is the leading reason that teen girls drop out of school. More than 50% of teen mothers never graduate from high school and
about 25%  of teen moms have a 2nd child within 24 months of their first baby, which leads to these teens to not have a college degree.
Less than 2% of teen moms earn a college degree by age 30.
In 2008,the teen pregnancy rate among African-American and Hispanic teen girls, ages 15 to 19, was over two and a half times higher than the teen pregnancy rate among white teen girls of the same age group.8 out of 10 teen dads donâ€™t marry the mother of their child.In fact, two-thirds of families begun by a young, unmarried mother are poor.
